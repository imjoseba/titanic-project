## About the project

The main idea of this project is to **explore** data while discovering interesting facts about the *Titanic*.

After loading the main *libraries*, the first step was to **load the dataset** and convert it into a **data frame**.".

Then, the data was cleaned to prepare it for analysis.

Finally, information was extracted from each column, and some of them were analyzed for correlations.

For an interactive visualization of the project, you can also check out the [PowerBI report here](https://app.powerbi.com/view?r=eyJrIjoiZDRhMjdmNTEtNTUyOC00ZWVhLWFhOWEtYTllMGVmNTU5YWI1IiwidCI6IjhhZWJkZGI2LTM0MTgtNDNhMS1hMjU1LWI5NjQxODZlY2M2NCIsImMiOjl9).

I hope you find it as interesting as I do; there is still much more to discover.

Comments are more than welcome.

Thank you for taking a look!
