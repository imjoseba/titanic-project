## About the project

The main idea of this project is to **explore** data while discovering interesting facts about the *Titanic*.

After loading the main *libraries*, the first step was to **load the dataset** and convert it into a **data frame**.".

Then, the data was cleaned to prepare it for analysis.

Finally, information was extracted from each column, and some of them were analyzed for correlations.

I hope you find it as interesting as I do; there is still much more to discover.

Comments are more than welcome.

Thank you for taking a look!
